            calculation. The systems will automatically be wrapped into
            compatible classes (using :py:func:`rascaline.systems.wrap_system`).
            Multiple types of systems are supported, see the documentation of
            :py:class:`rascaline.IntoSystem` to get the full list.

        :param use_native_system: If ``True`` (this is the default), copy data
            from the ``systems`` into Rust ``SimpleSystem``. This can be a lot
            faster than having to cross the FFI boundary often when accessing
            the neighbor list. Otherwise the Python neighbor list is used.

        :param gradients: List of gradients to compute. If this is ``None`` or
            an empty list ``[]``, no gradients are computed. Gradients are
            stored inside the different blocks, and can be accessed with
            ``descriptor.block(...).gradient(<parameter>)``, where
            ``<parameter>`` is ``"positions"`` or ``"cell"``. The following
            gradients are available:

            - ``"positions"``, for gradients of the representation with respect
              to the atomic positions;
            - ``"cell"``, for gradients of the representation with respect to
              the cell vectors. Cell gradients are computed as

              .. math::
                  \frac{\partial \langle q \vert A \rangle}
                       {\partial \mathbf{h}}

              where :math:`\mathbf{h}` is the cell matrix and :math:`\langle q
              \vert A \rangle` indicates each of the components of the
              representation.

              **Note**: When computing the virial, one often needs to evaluate
              the gradient of the representation with respect to the strain
              :math:`\epsilon`. To recover the typical expression from the cell
              gradient one has to multiply the cell gradients with the cell
              matrix :math:`\mathbf{h}`

              .. math::
                  -\frac{\partial \langle q \vert A \rangle}
                        {\partial\epsilon}

            If ``selected_samples`` is an :py:class:`equistore.TensorMap`, then
            the samples for each key will be used as-is when computing the

            If ``selected_samples`` is a set of :py:class:`equistore.Labels`
            containing the same variables as the default set of samples for this
            calculator, then only entries from the full set that also appear in
            ``selected_samples`` will be used.

            If ``selected_samples`` is a set of :py:class:`equistore.Labels`
            containing a subset of the variables of the default set of samples,
            then only samples from the default set with the same values for
            these variables as one of the entries in ``selected_samples`` will
            be used.

        :param selected_properties: Set of properties to compute. Use ``None``
            to run the calculation on all properties (this is the default).

            If ``selected_properties`` is an :py:class:`equistore.TensorMap`,
            then the properties for each key will be used as-is when computing

        :param selected_keys: Selection for the keys to include in the output.
            If this is ``None``, the default set of keys (as determined by the
